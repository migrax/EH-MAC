The program is able\r\nto simulate three different MAC algorithms: the original RI-MAC, PW-MAC and our Enhanced version.\r\nNodes are placed in the field according to a homogeneous Poisson distribution, while packet transmission at originating\r\nnodes can either be deterministic or follow a Poisson distribution.\r\n\r\nInvocation\r\n----------\r\n\r\n`enmac [-s seed] [-l side] [-m max_time] [-d node density] [-r per node rate] [-a R|P|E]`\r\n\r\nwhere side is the length of each side of the field, max_time is the siomulation time in seconds,\r\nand R, P and E correspond to the three implemented MAC algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe simulator outputs a line for every important event. The output should be self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nLegal\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright ⓒ Miguel Rodríguez Pérez <miguel@det.uvigo.es> 2015\r\n\r\nThis simulator is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0).
